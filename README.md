# Predicting where college basketball players will be drafted in the NBA draft and NBA performance

The NBA is a professional basketball league in North America. The NBA draft occurs at the end of June every year in which players are drafted by teams in the NBA. There are two rounds, each consisting of 30 picks, with a total of 60 picks.

The supervised learning portion of this project aims to predict the pick number of a player based on their college statistics. We also hope to gain insights into which features are important for determining where a player will be drafted. This could be a valuable resource for teams in their draft planning as knowing where a player will be drafted can help teams approach how they want to position themselves in the draft.

The unsupervised learning portion of this project aims to cluster players already in the NBA based on their statistics. The goal is to learn about which features are important for different groups of players.

We were motivated to do this project as we are all sports fans and wanted to learn more about gaining insights on player success through machine learning methods.

The NBA draft prediction model ended up getting within 15 picks of the correct pick number. The clustering methods grouped players based on how well they produced.
